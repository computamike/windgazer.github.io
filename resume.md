# Profile

I bring to your company a well-rounded developer who has had experience on all types of development. My passion for User-Machine interaction has tempered that experience into a specialization of CSS, HTML and in a slightly lesser degree Javascript. To your team I can provide some valuable insight on user behavior and I can inject the experience to challenge a team in providing more robust code. Meanwhile of course creating smooth and clean code that provides a robust User Interface to the end-user.

As any professional should, I maintain my own toolbox and will bring this to any job. Besides the knowledge in my head and various repositories of code-samples, I also carry my own development environment in the form of a Macintosh laptop and legal copies of commonly used software, plus the promise that any reasonably common software that I don't own, but do need for a job, I will purchase. Where reasonable I try to use open-source freely available software, like LibreOffice and Eclipse. However, I also own licenses for various commercial developer tools, including Adobe Photoshop.

# Publications and Presentations

## Real-World Game Audio Development with HTML5 (2013-07-30)

## Performance test your assumptions (2012-03-16)

## Virtueel stapelen met CSS (2006-02-21)

# Working experience, recent

## 2012 Team Lead, CSS Coach, Spilgames

### Team Lead

While already in Spilgames employment as an independent developer, I was offered a chance to further my career by becoming a team lead. After some deliberations I ended up setting up a new team of developers to develop casuals games using HTML5.

### CSS Coach

I was also requested to aid other development teams in improving their CSS knowledge. In a concerted effort we introduced SASS into the portal development of Spilgames. I was merely involved in an advisory roll with this.

## 2011 Senior Webdeveloper, Spilgames

### Framework development

Getting involved with a team that had seen a lot of change, both in code and in team-members, meant landing in a lot of technical debt. Together with another freelancer (Lars Kappert) I made the team aware of the need to remove this technical debt. We were able to completely rebuild the existing UI in two sprints of 2 weeks each. While before it would take a 2 week sprint for a single feature.

I was also able to couch/mentor a junior CSS developer into a more self-assured developer who is now also growing into other knowledge areas, such as JavaScript and PHP.

## 2010 User Experience refresher

### Consultant in User Experience

BrandsClub has been running a community driven webshop for over a year now and they are quite driven to move beyond the initial startup phase. As a result they started to take a more serious look at their current designs and realized that it would help to have an outsiders' perspective on things. I was asked to give the graphics designers a quick refresher on how to improve the user experience with some quick wins and also how to plan for a long-term structural improvement in the user experience of their shop.

## 2010 Tapestry 5 Startup Course, CH, BR

### Course Leader

For a few years I have been immersed in the Tapestry 5 framework for building web-sites and applications. Since this has been used to implement the BuyMe Core that I have been involved with, some of the company that I had contact with were interested in a quick knowledge session to get their developers up to speed. On two occasions I have been asked to give a quick startup course to these developers.

## 2009-2011 BuyMe Core, NL (Company located in Switzerland)

### Lead front-end developer (+12 Months)

After the successful implementation of Brands4Friends one of the investors was interested in working with us again to setup a similar project but with much more international potential in the application. Our original team of 3 developers (including me) have managed to set up a community driven ecommerce core with focus on ease of adaptation to different international environments, taking into account language, payment and even features and design.

This product has been used to setup shops in India, Dubai and Switzerland and we are negotiating further deployment in other countries as wel. Another product based on the same core has been launched in Brazil and Turkey.

# Education

* 1989-1992 HAVO Veenlanden College, Mijdrecht

    *Senior secondary school.* I have completed this education in 3 years instead of the 5 which is customary. I have received a certificate which is equal to that of a junior secondary school which usually takes 4 years to complete.
* 1992-1996 MBO SCUTOS, Utrecht (Senior vocational training)

    Specialized in *Telematics*, graduated in Telematics in 4 years.
* 1996-1997 HBO Hogeschool van Utrecht (Higher vocational training or vocational college)

    Specialized in *Informatics*. I have not completed this education, I have quit during the first of 4 years after finishing only a small number of classes,  database design, english, programming and data-communication.
* 2001 Course, Object Oriented Programming (SUN)

    A course to teach the concepts of Object Oriented Programming with a strong Java influence. I took this course to formalise the knowledge I was already employing.
