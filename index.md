Like the bend in the river that once was straight, the crack in your wind-shield that
started as chip, the ripples in the pond that was smooth as a river. A little pebble, so
seemingly insignificant can have a huge effect.

This is my blog, sometimes it'll get personal, sometimes it'll get technical and sometimes
even I might not have known what I was thinking! I try to keep it light, I try to fight
against the 'common knowledge' misconception, but sometimes I just need to get something
of my chest...

So, I hope you'll stick around and find something of your liking. Don't be shy to leave a
comment, I'd love to know what you think, and, have a nice day ;)
