# My place to rant and rave

  Not so long ago I used to have a blog. This was a nice thing, a place where I could put
down my thoughts and people could read them, or ignore them, whichever they pleased. For a
time it was a great thing, then my server died, while I was on the road and things never
really were the same.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; But now I find myself again missing a place to just dump my train of thought, where people
can read them, or ignore them. So if you're still reading, have a gander and see if
there's anything here that peeks your interest.
