# About the insignificant pebble

Although the name may seem like I have a rather negative self-image, this is not what the
intention of the name signifies. Like the ripple in the pond can make a wave, something
must have made that ripple. The bend of the river must have started with something. The
crack in your wind-shield must have been caused by something. So, a pebble. It may not
seem like much, but perhaps that insignificant little bit of information can change your
life, and maybe you will change the world, and maybe it was me that got you going in the
right direction.  

In my day to day work I quite often notice that the greatest issues start over what turns
out to be a simple assumption. Usually the assumption that somebody has that critical
piece of information that you've been regarding as common knowledge.

> Common sense is not so common. *Voltaire*

So, to make a small dent in that great awesome lack of common sense I try to, sometimes,
remind myself to just throw it out there, on the net...

I'm also experimenting a lot with simplicity in 'design'. My aim being to actually not
design too much (since I can't) and have a better focus on the content. At times this
messing about might of course just make things worse.

## Technology

This blog in the end is also an exercise in simplicity, although this may not mean that
what I find simple, is also useful for non-technical people. And as such I've been looking
a long time for a satisfying way of blogging by use of [markdown][1]. A very popular
format with us programmers.

Although when I started looking, github wasn't quite as far along yet, by now their
[github pages][2] solution is just about perfect. You can build pages and posts in
markdown, template using [handlebars][3] and all of that is processed using [Jekyll][4].
Github also provides a way of running this stack on your own computer so you can work on
your blog offline, and publish whenever you're finished tinkering.

Pretty much the perfect solution for me and as anything on this site is up for grabs if
you need it, you can see the [bare bones][5] of this blog over on github.

## Attribution

And to conclude I would like attribute some of the projects / art / fonts I make use of.
Some demand it, some don't, they all deserve it though:

- [Github][a1] for being awesome and a live-changer in version control.
- [Daring Fireball][a2] for showing us the way to [markdown][1].
- [Google][a3] who could live without it these days?
- [Santiago Orozco][a4] for his 'Josefin Sans' font-face
- [Impallari][a5] for their 'Libre Baskerville' font-face
- [Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Tunni][a6] for his 'Gabriela' font-face
- [Pablo Impallari][a7] for his 'Quattrocento' font-face
- [Barry Schwartz][a8] for his 'Linden Hill' font-face
- [Vernon Adams][a9] for his 'Coda' font-face

Yes, I'm playing too much with font faces ;)
