# About the insignificant pebble

Although the name may seem like I have a rather negative self-image, this is not what the
intention of the name signifies. Like the ripple in the pond can make a wave, something
must have made that ripple. The bend of the river must have started with something. The
crack in your wind-shield must have been caused by something. So, a pebble. It may not
seem like much, but perhaps that insignificant little bit of information can change your
life, and maybe you will change the world, and maybe it was me that got you going in the
right direction.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; In my day to day work I quite often notice that the greatest issues start over what turns
out to be a simple assumption. Usually the assumption that somebody has that critical
piece of information that you've been regarding as common knowledge.

So, to make a small dent in that great awesome lack of common sense I try to, sometimes,
remind myself to just throw it out there, on the net...
