So, again time as gone by like there's no tomorrow. Here I am struggling to keep you guys
updated, and faling sorely! No matter, that is as things are. For those of you who at
least want to know I'm still alive and see pretty things in the process, keep up to date
with my [flickr photo-set][flickrset] as making sure I have my pictures backed up is
critically important, I do sometimes burst the best of those onto that photo-album, even
if I do not have time to blog... So, on to the journey :)

## The Great Barrier Reef

We finally got around to our first diving trip!! Although it took a lot of heavy
consideration to figure out which trip to make, we finally settled on a one day, 3 dives,
quick trip out on one of the quicksilver boats. It got us to the 'outer reef' where the
diving is supposed to be best!

We've seen quite a few things underwater and it had been a while since we'd been diving.
So, it turned out to be a nice relaxing way to get re-acquainted with the water :) The
boat was ridiculously luxurious. Big, catamaran style, air-conditioned main lounge and
upper deck, all gear set up for our use. All we had to do was put on a shorty, tanks on
our back and jump in! There we had a relaxed swim around the reefs, following our dive-
master.

Not quite as impressive as the west coast, but good dive even so. I do believe the great
barrier reef is being over-exposed as well as over-hyped. It's good diving, for something
so accessible, but there's certainly better to be found in the world. Our last dive was
a little more of fun dive though, jumping of the moving boat like commandoes, tap on the
shoulder, jump in, turn around and give ok then move away from the boat on the double! We
saw some sharks on our outing, one of which was resting on the bottom of the ocean (a
breed of sharks that doesn't need to move to breath!) and some unfortunate hard swimming
against a current to get to the main spot where the boat was anchored. Good times!

## Cape Tribulation

Cape tribulation was to be next on the menu and we'd planned to spend a couple of days out
on the cape. The main features of cape tribulation are it's age old rain-forrest, mangrove
and pristine beaches.

Concerning those beaches, as the picture tells a thousand words... There's a reason they
are pristine. If it isn't the stingers that get you, it'll be the crocs! These beaches may
be pristine, beautiful, paradise, etc. They also are completely unusable because of the
various dangers lurking about.

Anyways, it still all was incredibly pretty and alive. We learned a lot about Mangroves
and were even lucky enough to see a [Cassowary][wikiI] with three chicks close to the
boardwalks we were traversing. It's an odd bird and apparently not so common that
everybody gets to see it while travelling the 'far north'. Some late afternoon hunt for a
phone-call got us a camp-ground for cheap and we set the alarm-clock for 5:30 to get on
the tracks early the next morning.

We were the first on the track up on Mount Sorrow. It was another stark reminder that I'm
a little out of shape... But apart from also being the last to get back to the car, due to
Sandra almost physically dragging me up the track, it was a beautiful experience. Sandra
at some point grabbed a tree for a hand-hold only a split-second later realising that what
her hand was on was actually the scaled skin of a "Boyd's Forrest Dragon"! The little
dragon shrugged it of like a veteran and allowed us to take plenty of time for some good
photo's. That on it's own would've made all my sorrow's worth it, but later we also got
ourselves a rather unique show from the lookout. While we'd managed to get into / on top
of the clouds, those clouds suddenly opened up to show us a glance of the valley below. It
was an almost magical experience and quite likely only better for it.

The next day, with some serious muscle aches we got ourselves educated at "Daintree
Discovery Centre", which was honestly a really good experience. Better than doing the
touristy Crocodile tour, in which we didn't actually get to see any crocs :( I know these
trips don't come with a guarantee, but it was still disappointing.


## Cairns (and surrounding area)

So on our way to Cairn we went up to Kuranda. We actually went there to go have a look at
the "Barron Falls" but, although we also went to look at the falls, ended up spending a
few hours walking around this touristy, but not over the top so, town. The atmosphere of
the town was just so relaxed and the shops not too terrible either.

Cairns itself I can be relatively short about. It's a lovely town. Not too big, not too
small. Like most bigger towns in Australia quite planned out. Special features should
include the big public swimming pool on the esplanade as well as various fitness equipment
and a running track. All of this available for free, no excuse not to be fit when living
in Cairns!

## Tully River

What came next was a fun and incredibly touristy white-water rafter trip down the Tully
river. Don't get me wrong, we had heaps of fun. But on the other hand, there were a total
of 11 boats going down the river together. Part of this was that some of the boats would
stop at the start of a big rapid so that the guide could go ashore and supply safety lines
to people falling out of the rafts. No biggy, but then it did mean a lot of waiting.

The trip was also incredibly lazy. On previous experiences we'd had much more peddling and
other action needs to help the guide get the raft down the river. Here we were pretty much
limited to forward, backward, get down. It did feel a little like cheating. Altogether, a
good enjoying day on the river, not entirely sure it was worth the price of admission,
but close enough I suppose.

## S.S. Yongala

A bit of a drive and getting ready to wake up early, this is what got us quickly down to
Townsville, or close to it at least. We found ourselves another nice free camping spot.
With even toilets and really officially a camping spot, just with a 48 hour limit.

Townsville still isn't worth much to a traveller except those that do diving. Straight to
the harbour and checking in with our boat, the "Adrenalin". The big dive of Australia was
about to set of! A quick stop at nearby Magnetic Island and our boat dove into the choppy
waters on our 3 hour trip outside the Great Barrier reef to the location of the "S.S.
Yongala".

I looked up what I wrote in my dive-logs the first time I went diving at this most
stunning of dive-sites, it said "too beautiful to describe in words". I would leave it at
that, but I figure you should at least get some idea...

We started out on a choppy ocean, with Sandra quite unwell because of motion sickness. The
solution is quite simple, get to 5m below ASAP. The mouth-piece of my main regulator had
come lose while swimming out to the guide-lines so we quickly decided I would go down on
the secondary, knowing that in a pinch I'd still be able to use the main.

Five meters down, the initial rush is over, the quiet of being underwater takes over. All
we hear is our own breath and bubbles and the blue waters of the ocean is all we see
around us while below the contours of a ship slowly start showing themselves through the
haze. Visibility is close to 20 meters and soon details start filling in. The ship is
covered in coral and life! So much life! This is what people expect when coming out to the
reef. School of fish, sea snakes, turtles, rays, huge groupers.

We slowly made our way to the stern of the ship taking in the sights as best we could. We
must've seen at least 10 olive sea snakes along the way. And then, halfway down the ship,
Sandra spots a big sea turtle, asleep in a little nook. It actually stirs from sleep and
comes up slowly, moving across the wreck, on it's way to the surface to get a breath of
air. So beautiful and we can take our time too, nobody else is waiting for us, just the
two of us, since there's no way to get lost out here we didn't even need a dive-master
around. We saw much more, took closer looks at the wreck here and there, but this should
at least give you some idea of what diving out there is like.
