excerpt: The Vikings may be seen as barbarians, but they've always been more cultured than we'd like to admit.

Making our ways back from the 'far north' we started immersing ourselves into the Viking
stories and archeological sites. We did not pace ourselves on this part of the trip, we
went headlong into some hiking, and strenuous reading ;). But how does one condense yet
another week of traveling into something short and enjoyable to read?

## Dead men and living trees

We started our track back down the east coast of the mainland by visiting a site holding
the corpse of a 2500 year old, unsolved, murder-case! That might make it sound a whole lot
more exciting than reality, but the corpse, none-the-less, is pretty damn old and quite
well-preserved, thank you peat bogs.

While leaving this old man behind us we then went for something quite the opposite and
spent some long hours meandering around the hills of a nature preserve. Some interresting
background is that this particular preserve was created around a piece of land that was
donated to the state of Denmark with the express rules that the plot would retain it's
natural state and that American holidays would be respected (and perhaps even celebrated)
on this land. The state decided to add some extra hectares to the plot and the best I can
describe the result to dutch people is that it's kind of like the 'Amsterdame Bos', only
with a lot of hills, and slightly different vegetation.

## Animals and Art

I know, chronologically, after this walk-about, we visited a zoo, might have been a day
between that I can't quite recall. However, the zoo was quite memorable. From the very
start of our finding the zoo, everything about it would stick you. The entrance was quite
anti-climactic, in that it was a simple wooden entrance post, followed by grassy parking
spots. We could've easily snuck our way in by climbing a fence, but decided to go through
the little shop/entrance.

The zoo in question, does not have all that many animals, only some 20 odd species. Again
quite easy to recall this zoo however due to it sticking to a simple theme, the Nordics.
Being in Denmark this made it easy to create suitable habitats. Also space is not much of
an issue in this part of Denmark and result is an almost nature-like zoo, where you can
see the animals are in their element.

An often lamented issue with a zoo is how hard it is to spot certain animals. Even this
was taken care of. All we had to do was follow the staff on their leisurely feeding rounds
and the animals would happily show their faces to us...

We're both quite fond of wolves, hence the picture of the first animals we'd see. However,
the amount of pictures I took of the wolves, pales in comparison with those of the bears.
I'll have to show you some of those picture when I get back and have had the time to fully
sort them...

We ended this day by driving down to an old light-house. We've spent many nights on spots
where we were legally allowed to freely park our camper-van. Most do not bear mentioning,
this one however cannot be left without a few words.

[!["The lighthouse"][imgIII]][III]

The spot in its self was quite magical. At the end of a relatively unvisited peninsula,
you'll find yourself at a light-house overlooking a major ferry route. Across the bay you
can spot the harbour of Aarhus and as the sun sets behind the city, slowly the twinkling
lights of the city become faint dots on the horizon.

By this time any day-time visitors have long since left and gone home. Now there's only
some camper-vans with friendly people. Oh, and then I even forgot to mention that near
sunset, in the shallow water near the beach, the Harbour Porpoise (Bruinvis) come out and
play, or more likely eat.

We did not spend much time at Aarhus the next day. Although we thoroughly enjoyed their
Art museum, ARoS. Although the hinted Dante's ascension from hell to heaven was quite
disappointingly far fetched, we enjoyed all the exhibits above the cellar level.

## The Vikings

The next few days we dove into the old days and visited some archeological sites detailing
some viking related 'stuff'. The first of which being an old burial site, where a king
had been burried in his old viking ship, along with some horses, dogs, treasure, weapons,
you know, stuff you'll need in the after-life...

As a hobby some of the locals took a few years of planning to slowly but surely create an
authentic replica of the ship, as you may have guessed from the picture, they're finished
and it floats! Quite an impressive feat and possibly an even more impressive sight.

Somewhere along the way we crossed a bridge worth mentioning. This particular bridge is
18km long.... And we read somewhere, the highest building in Denmark :) Fancy that!
Anyways, it took a while to cross, it was big, mind-boggling and quite an engineering
marvel.

This took us to the 'big island'. Where Kopenhagen is to be found, from where you could
cross another mention worthy bridge to sweden, but that's for later, we first went to
visit a ring fortress.

Trust me when I say, the picture doesn't quite, paint the picture. First, the scale will
be lost on you, at least click on it to have a look at a larger version. But even then I
doubt you'll be able to fathom the magnificence of this fortress. Even back in the Viking
days, people were quite smart in what they did. And the scale at which they manufactured
this fortification, combined with a planned interior of four long-houses in perfect
alignment. I was seriously impressed with this whole endeavour and will save the story for
the interested people to tell you in person :)

## Creepy trees and Culture

Finally the last day I want to tell you about before closing this post (and before we
enter Kopenhagen) we set out early, after having spent the night with an older lady who
was self-sufficiently living with goats, cats, gardens and a nice patch to park the van
(she even gave us some eggs and tomatoes to go!). Sandra had a beautiful plan for the
entire day, which was thrown out the window as soon as we ran into a park-ranger on our
morning hike.

The ranger in question told us a lot about the forrest we had entered. While we were there
to have a look at some 'twisted trees', it turned out this forrest had much significance.
The forrest had been created to stop a migrating Dune from taking more villages and as a
result, under the sand history was preserved. And on top of the sand an out-of-place pine
forrest was to be found. After a good talk, we still did the originally planned 2 hour
hike, although we missed a few turns here and there and may have spent a little more time
hiking.

Nevermind that though, we made it back to the van and travelled onwards. We then spent the
rest of the day at two rather unique and different castles. First we visited 'Kronborg',
which some may know as the castle in which Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' was to have taken place.
Subsequently we visited 'Fredriksborg', which was much more opulent, Sandra at some point
even mentioned that she felt like we'd ended up in Versaille! Both had there strong points
and both were beautiful. We went from the lost past of the Vikings to the well-documented,
much painted culture of the near-past of Denmark.

I must admit though, at the latter castle I was looking more at the spectacular ceilings
than I was looking at the exhibited paintings and such. But the following marvel that I
leave you with did quite draw my attention:
